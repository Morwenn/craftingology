Craftingoloy is a small RDF/XML ontology about general crafting.

Once upon a pandemic, I was stuck at home and decided to give another look to my garden: while barely maintained, I
knew that it was a land of potential. Armed with curiosity, patience, and more time home than I would have liked, I
started to methodically identify the flowers, herbs, shrubs, trees and other plants - despite its relatively small
size, it is home to a bunch of different ecological niches and the number of species to identify was staggering - at
some point I had already reached a hundred deifferent plant species, and the list was still growing as the seasons
passed by.

Halfway through that tedious identification process, I decided to read more about those plants: are they edible? Is it
safe? Are there other historical uses? The cooking sessions began, I discovered new palettes of tastes and the
possibilities seemed to go even beyond that. It turned out that those plants, when used to their full potential, were
formidably diverse in their uses.

Fast-forward to a few weeks from this initial commit: my new-found knowledge was disorganized and split in several
places that I had to find again whenever I needed to use it again. So the next phase of that project began: building a
knowledge base that could be searched in useful ways. Despite little knowledge about the area, I started to look at
graph databases and their powerful query languages. After some experimentations, I came to the logical conclusion that
my starting point should be to create an ontology - the database and queries would come later.

And that small ontology is the result of that work: a single RDF/XML file created with owlready2. The data used to fill
the quadstore is not part of this project because it is somewhat personal (and it's also mostly in French because it is
the language I use to reason about plants, resources and crafting), but the ontology can freely be used for similar
projects. Hope you enjoyed the pompous story.

Yours truly,

Morwenn
